		<p>Done by Deer is for families who believe life with kids and life with great design is a perfect match.</p>
		<p>Our design is done for the kids – and their parents. We are deeply rooted in toy-making and strive to combine modern Scandinavian design with features that are fun and playful. Our designs stimulate the child’s senses and development with materials, colour combinations, and details that little fingers and eyes love to explore. Not to mention our cute cuddle toys.</p>
		<p>Done by Deer has a distinctive graphic edge and a clear reference to Scandinavian style of life. The philosophy is simple: We combine innovative design, safety, and a daring use of contemporary colours. All our products are designed in-house by Helene Hjorth and sold through a growing network of distributors in Scandinavia and most of Europe.</p>
		<p>This makes every item Done by Deer outstanding.</p>
		<p>Everything Done by Deer is 100% friendly and naturally tested thoroughly to comply or exceed strict European safety standards.</p>
